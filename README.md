# bun-test
Createing an simple Rest API in TS to test [Bun](https://bun.sh) :D

This API is inspired by the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) Python framework, but made in TypeScript. Most of my experience is as a Pythonista, so I am trying to mix that with some TS. This project is just 4fun.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run start
```
